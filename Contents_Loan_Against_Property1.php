  <div id="txt"><h1>Loan Against Property</h1>
  
 <P >Simply put, a 


   <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loan-against-property.php">loan against property</a> is what it actually connotes -- a loan given or disbursed against the mortgage of property. This is unlike a <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/personal-loans.php">personal loan</a>, which is disbursed to an individual; no questions asked. The loan is given as a certain percentage of the property's market value (usually around 40 per cent-60 per cent). But the threshold amount too is generally defined by most lending institutions like say, Rs 200,000. This multi-purpose <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/">loan</a> puts funds at your disposal to use as you wish. It unlocks the hidden value in the property you own. </P>
