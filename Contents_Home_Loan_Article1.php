        <p><b>Salary/ITR- </b><br>
          Higher the salary of an individual more is the chances for greater eligibility of a loan amount. </p>
        <p><b>Property/Check- </b><br>
          Banks check whether the property selected by you is ideal according to the technical & legal norms. Most importantly, they check the authorities have sanctioned property or not. Therefore, before deciding the property do check the property has approved sanctioned plans & complies with legal & technical aspects of the property.</p>
        <p><b>Your Profile, Academic & Professional Background-</b><br>
          Banks credit manager decisions are leveraged on your profile, academic & professional qualification. As it is a long-term commitment with the bank, they analyze on potential growth in your career graph, industry you are working in & kind of profile you are into. Like, Call centers/BPOs are not treated at par with other profiles, as they tend to have high attrition rates. Banks generally want an applicant with stable job hence check for current & total work experience. Doctor’s, engineer’s, CA, Mgmt etc., sway banker’s decisions as they see the potential growth in their careers.</p>
        <p><b>Your Credit/default profile-</b><br>
        Banks verify whether you have defaulted any or previous loan repayments. This is done against both internal systems and plus third party systems like Cibil/Satyam. So now, it is tough to have bad debts with one bank & take loan from other bank.</p>
        <p><b>Family Credit History-</b><br>
          Banks also verify the financial records of your blood relation with the help of Cibil/Satyam. If they have defaulted then you are in a fix. You need to get to unnecessary hassles so, it’s always advised to have clean record with the banks.</p>
        <p> Generally, banks check these things before giving  loans. Basically, they check your ability to pay, assess your intention to pay & the property they are funding is safe or not? </p>
