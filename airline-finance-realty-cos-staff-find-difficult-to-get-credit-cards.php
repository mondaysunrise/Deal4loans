        <p>If you have a start-up, work for a finance company, airline or a small-time realtor, you may not get a credit card. The banking sector is 
          
          Summarily rejecting credit card applications from such quarters as the deteriorating financial health and economic downturn leads to less creditworthiness. </p>
        <p>"The credit card applications of several employees of my company, including myself, have been rejected. Last month, different banks turned down credit card requests," said an employee of a major New Delhi-based finance company, requesting anonymity. </p>
        <p>The Indian arm of HSBC recently tightened its credit approval mechanism for employees of real estate and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs). "HSBC regularly monitors and reviews the policies governing its lending business and the risk factors related to its various products, as a matter of routine," the bank said in an e-mailed response.</p>
        <p>The UK-based bank is not alone. State-run and private banks are also making their credit criteria more stringent by expanding the negative list of applicant profiles who are denied credit. A large Mumbai-based public sector bank has stopped extending credit to small entrepreneurs, while a private bank has made the scrutiny of applications from airlines and call centers more rigorous. </p>
        <p>Until recently, the negative list featured reporters, lawyers, chartered accountants and junior-level police and armed forces personnel. The list is now expanding, although the law prohibits banks from denying credit based on profession. But for a banking sector keen on protecting itself from rising bad debts and increasing job losses in a slowing economy, this law may be difficult to follow.</p>
        <p>Banks do not cite an applicant's profession as  the reason for denying credit, although many bankers privately admit that a  negative list of professions and companies exists. &quot;We have been strictly  advised not to entertain the application of selected companies, especially for home loans and credit cards,&rdquo; said an official at one of India's largest state-run banks on  grounds of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The new negative list includes real estate  companies having exposure to NBFCs and some poorly-performing consumer goods  companies, the official added. Another state-run bank official, who did not  wish to be identified, said his bank was denying credit to small shop-keepers  and employees of companies that suffered erosion in market capitalisation and  revenues.</p>
        <p>The finance sector employees are being denied  credit because of the sector's exposure to a volatile stock market. The airline  workers are losing out on credit due to job cuts, while shop-owners are a  victim of fears that their income could be hit by the economic downturn. &quot;We need  to undertake our own due diligence to decide the creditworthiness of a borrower  and the definition keeps changing from time to time,&quot; according to a  state-run bank official.<br>
