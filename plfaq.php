                        <p>An unsecured loan is called a Personal loan. This implies that you don’t have to give any security, as with a car loan or a home loan, where the underlying asset is mortgaged with the bank. Normally, the bank does not ask for guarantors either. More advantages: minimum documentation and speedy clearance (within three to seven days of applying). And there is no monitoring of ‘end use’ -- you can use the loan for any purpose you like.</p>
