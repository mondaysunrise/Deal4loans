<p class="tbl_txt"><strong>Home Credit Option </strong><br />
</p>
<p>With its innovative Home  Credit facility, Citibank gives its borrowers the flexibility to select the  credit option of their choice and decide the interest they want to pay.<br />
  In Home Credit loans, a  current account Home Credit Account is linked to the borrower&rsquo;s loan account. A  threshold is set and the amount excess to it is transferred to the borrower&rsquo;s  loan account daily to offset the interest outgo. The borrower is free to withdraw  the amount as overdraft line.<br />
  As per their requirement,  borrowers may choose between two Home Credit loan options:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:35px;">
  <li><strong>Home Credit  Vanilla:</strong> This facility helps the  borrowers to maintain liquidity. In this option, an overdraft line is fixed  which keeps on increasing through savings on interest out of home credit  facility. The increase in credit line is always at the customer&rsquo;s disposal for  withdrawal. </li>
  <li><strong>Home</strong> <strong>Credit Fast  Track:</strong> This option helps the borrower to make repayments faster. The  savings on interest outgo are adjusted in the outstanding loan amount which  reduces repayment tenure in the long run and helps customer repay loan  early.Â 
  </li>
</ul><br />
     <p><strong>How much home loan can I get? </strong><br />
       Citibank offers loan starting  from Rs 5 lakh to a maximum of Rs 10 crore.</p>

     <p><strong>Repayment Tenure:</strong> Borrowers may choose repayment tenure as per their repayment capacity.  The maximum tenure ranges up to 25 years.</p>
     <br />

     <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> To apply for home loan from Citibank, a borrower must be at least 23 years of  age with a minimum work experience of two years.</p> <br />
     <p><strong>Is top-up loan available for existing borrowers?</strong><br />
       For existing home loan  customers who have been making repayments for over a year, Citibank offers top-up  loans. However, the bank reserves the right to take a final decision on a  top-up loan application.</p> <br />
