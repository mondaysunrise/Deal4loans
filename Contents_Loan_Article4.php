	 <div id="txt"><h1>   Financing the festive season</h1>

<p>The typical Indian festive season starts with the Navratri, followed by Dussera, Diwali, Christmas and the New Year. Festivals bring with them loads of fun, entertainment, shopping, socializing and whether we like it or not, additional expenses.</p><p>
Shopping has come to be a key ingredient of the festivities. Since gifting items to near and dear ones is a custom that is strictly followed by many. So all of us should start thinking about this festive funding as soon as possible and in case you plan to borrow money to celebrate these festivals now is the time to apply.<br>
<br>
For this you have some options,<br>

&bull; Cash Purchases (If you have enough bank balance)<br>
&bull; <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/credit-cards.php">Credit Cards</a> <br>
&bull; EMI on Credit Cards<br>
&bull; <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/personal-loans.php">Personal Loans</a> <br>
<br>
<b>Cash purchases</b> imply that you have enough spare cash in hand to nullify your festive expenditures, i.e. you can meet all your expenses (renovation, celebration, gifts etc) with the idle cash you have. This is the most efficient way, but many times during festivities this is not really possible with your current income and liquidating your savings is not a considered the best option by many of us. So we need to think of various channels, which can provide us easy finance at lowest rate of interest.<br>
<br>
<b><a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/credit-cards.php">Credit Card</a></b>  is an efficient way to finance your purchases and avail interest free credit period (normally 40-55 days). During the festive season, banks come up with various discount offers; reward point program and cash back schemes to aid the customers. For instance, you can avail discounts up to 50% with your

Credit card is an efficient tool to enjoy interest free credit purchases. But to be a smart customer you should know the following key points about the card you want to go for:<br>
<br>

&bull; Annual fee<br>
&bull; Processing fee<br>
&bull; Billing cycle<br>
&bull; Credit limit on your card<br>
&bull; Interest rate<br>
&bull; Reward points program<br>
&bull; Latest discount offers<br>
<br>

All these things should be known to you before you own a credit card. And the most important area to understand when you own a card is that you should always pay <b>Total Amount Due</b> before the <b>Due Date</b> and take the best advantage of the card you are holding. In nut shell, it is true that credit card is a key for locked door of finance, but you should understand the tool well in order to enjoy its benefits. </p>
<p>
<b>EMI Credit Card </b>means that some banks give their customers an option to convert their big purchases done using your credit card into Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs - it is a fixed amount that you pay every month for a fixed period of time). On these EMIs a comparatively lesser rate of interest is charged as compared to Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Key points to be taken into consideration:<br>
<br>

&bull; Budget the EMIs in accordance to your disposable income<br>
&bull; Do not stretch them for longer tenorsM<br>
&bull; Look for the card that gives you the most favorable interest rate.<br>
<br>

So what you need to do is, plan all your purchases using your credit card and then converting them to EMIs to pay off your Total Amount Due, which would not only save you from paying a heavy interest rate but would also spread your purchases into EMIs.</p>
<p>
<b>Personal Loan</b> is an unsecured loan. This implies that you don't have to give any security, as with a 


<a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/car-loans.php">car loan</a> or a <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/home-loans.php">home loan</a>.  Some advantages: minimal documentation, speedy clearance (within three to seven days of applying) and there is no monitoring of 'end use' -- you can use the loan for any purpose you like.
As explained, the personal loan is another alternative through which you can finance your expenses. Various key points to be noted before going in for a 


<a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/personal-loans.php">Personal Loan</a>  are:<br>
<br>
&bull; Check your eligibility with different banks<br>
&bull; Compare the EMIs<br>
&bull; Consider the processing fee involved<br>
&bull; Ask about pre-payment charges<br>
<br>
