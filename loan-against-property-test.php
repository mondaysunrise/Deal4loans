  <h1  >Loan Against Property</h1>
  <div id="txt"><P >Simply put, a loan against property is what it actually connotes -- a loan given or disbursed against the mortgage of property. This is unlike a <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/personal-loans.php" title="personal loan">personal  loan</a>, which is disbursed to an individual; no questions asked. The loan is given as a certain percentage of the property's market value (usually around 40 per cent-60 per cent). But the threshold amount too is generally defined by most lending institutions like say, Rs 200,000. This multi-purpose loan puts funds at your disposal to use as you wish. It unlocks the hidden value in the property you own.</P>
