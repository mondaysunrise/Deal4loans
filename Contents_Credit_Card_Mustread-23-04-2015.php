        <br>
        A Credit card today provides you with not only shopping convenience and safety, but also offers you privileges like discount coupons, invitations to events, bonus points, cash-back and even a free insurance.<br>
        <br>
        If you have one, great- find the next one that can address your needs better and if you haven't then what are you waiting for!<br>
        <br>
        But how do you select the right credit card With so many variants available and numerous offers and promotions, choosing a card can be very difficult.<br>
        But mostly, it comes down to how you plan to use your Credit card.<br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>For those who are new to the world of Credit card, let's find out some basics of a Credit card.</strong></span>
        <ul style="margin-left:25px;">
          <li>When deciding on a card, always remember to get something that suits you best and fits well into your needs. The innovations are fast and coming and are never-ending.</li>
          <li>Do not rush. Look around and compare aspects like credit limit, grace period, renewal/annual fees, initial membership fee and other such services.</li>
          <li>Asking your friends about the cards they use might help too.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        When you<a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/apply-credit-card.php" title="apply Credit card">apply  Credit card</a>, the application  you submit is carefully analyzed and the documents you provide are verified. Then a credit limit for your card is set for you, based on your net income, your credit history and other such factors.<br>
        <br>
        Credit limit is the total amount that you may spend with your card while paying for services. Consider the lowest limit that would fit your needs, and not your lifestyle.<br>
        <br>
        Most Credit cards offer a grace period of 15- 25 days before the interest is charged on the purchase. But some may not. So find one with the longest grace period. The longer, the better.<br>
        Most banks charge annual fee, renewal fee, membership fee etc. You should always ask for these to be waived off of. Also do read the terms and conditions carefully.<br>
        <br>
        Do figure out the interest rate (APR) that you would be charged and try to get the card with the lowest possible rates. Most companies charge about 2% - 3% per month, which per year comes to around 35% - 45%.<br>
        <br>
        You can either pay your bills by clearing all your dues as soon as you get your monthly 
        billing statement or you could pay in monthly installments.Make sure you settle your bills on time and do not leave any outstanding balance (i.e. do not revolve on your card). You do not want to end up paying interest on your outstanding balance. Non-payment or default in repayment could also adversely affect your credit history.<br>
        <br>
        If your credit history is good, you could request for an increment on your credit limits.<br>
        If there are cards you may not be using anymore, you might want to cancel them. If you have multiple cards from the same issuing bank, you could also ask for the credit limit to be consolidated into just one card.<br>
        <br>
        Eventually, the decision to choose a Credit card is yours to make. Avail a card that fits your needs. And don't forget the interest rates, the grace period, the free offers, the discounts and the likes.<br>
