  <div id="txt"><h1>Banks gear up for agents norms</h1>
    <p>Banks are gearing up to meet the stringent norms on recovery agents that are likely to be laid down by RBI. However, a number of private and foreign banks are also critical of RBI's decision on action against banks, whose recovery agents' behaviour is not appropriate. </p>
    <p>RBI on Tuesday said the regulator would consider imposing a ban on recovery agents, if it is found that they are resorting to abusive practices to recover loan. </p>
    <p>
  <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/hdfc-bank-hdfc-ltd/">HDFC Bank</a> chairman Deepak Parekh said RBI's concern is justified as no society would allow recovery agents to take law in their hands for recovering money. A licensing system could be started to identify good agents and responsibility to recovery dues could be given only to licensed agents, he added.</p>
<p>Parekh said banks could outsource the recovery job to only responsible agents. He, however, maintained that <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/hdfc-bank-hdfc-ltd/">HDFC</a> outsources only a small portion of its recovery business to private agency. </p>
<p>Foreign banks are also in the process of streamlining recovery businesses. CEO of StanChart Neeraj Swarup said only a small portion of its recovery business is outsourced. Also, the banks' agents need to follow a particular code of conduct, otherwise, they are subject to strict actions. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/sbi-state-bank-of-india-loan/">SBI</a> is already appointing 3,000 officers directly. These officers would be used in recovery of bad <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/">loan</a>. Others like <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/icici-bank-icici/">ICICI Bank</a>, IDBI Bank and Axis bank have also tighten the noose around recovery agents to ensure proper behaviour with defaulting customers. </p>
<p>CEO of a private sector bank said RBI's move will discourage banks to lend marginal borrowers, whose chances of defaults are high. CEO of a large foreign bank added that the decision will encourage willful defaulters. He said recovery agents become abusive in very few cases like one in a thousand.</p>
<p>Many bankers said they have already taken strong measures to curb any misuse by recovery agents. They said banks follow the &quot;model policy on collection of dues and repossession of security&quot; prepared by Indian Banks' Association. One bank said because of stringent conditions put on the recovery agents, their efficiencies have already gone down. </p>
<p>Citibank, ICICI Bank, StanChart, IDBI Bank and HDFC Bank among others have already told their recovery agents that if a complaint is received from customers, they will take action against them. </p>
<p>A banker said there was hardly any recovery done by agents. He said willful defaulters normally create a scene and file complaints against agents. </p>
