        <p> <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/home-loans.php">Home loan</a> consumers in India may get some good news in the months to come with country's biggest private lender <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/icici-bank-icici/">ICICI Bank</a> saying it could cut interest rates in the first quarter of next fiscal. </p>
        <p>Lower rates would not be only for new customers, but existing floating-rate clients also, ICICI Bank's Managing Director and CEO K V Kamath said in an interview. </p>
        <p>&quot;We expect the (interest) rates to drop in the first quarter. After that we will see if we can write down the rates (for our customers),&quot; Kamath said when asked if ICICI Bank would cut housing loan rates. </p>
        <p>The bank is also looking to start risk-based pricing, under which it would start offering lower rates to consumers with better creditworthiness, in about two years, he said. </p>
        <p>However, any rate cut for consumers, who have had to reel under a number of interest rate hikes in the current fiscal, would depend on benchmark interest rate trends developing over the coming months. </p>
        <p>Ruling out any possibility of interest rates firming up in the near future, the <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/icici-bank-icici/">ICICI</a> bank chief said, &quot;I do not foresee an immediate increase in <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/home-loans-interest-rates.php">home loan rates</a>. To me that is good news. At least, you are able to contain the rates.&quot; </p>
        <p>Stating that the job of a banker also involves bringing down the rates, Kamath said, &quot;We will have to ride out this quarter. Every bank would have to ride out this quarter. Because the last quarter of a year is the quarter when things go haywire. Then you expect the first quarter of the next year to correct.&quot; </p>
        <p>Last week, another leading housing loan company <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/hdfc-bank-hdfc-ltd/">HDFC</a> Chairman Deepak Parekh had said in Mumbai that he expected interest rates to soften by 25-50 basis points in the first quarter, given RBI does not hike the cash reserve ratio. </p>
        <p>&quot;The whole problem was created last year (fiscal 2006-07), when the last quarter rates ran up and no correction took place in the first quarter of current year (2007-08),&quot; Kamath said. </p>
        <p>He said that the bank's strategy would be to see that it does not let interest rates run away during the last quarter of this year (January-March 2008) so that the next quarter would be stable. &quot;That's why we are trying to contain the costs. That's why confidently we are saying that there would not be any increase in rates.&quot; <br />
          <br />
          He added that the rate hikes kept on happening after first rise in February 2007. </p>
        <p>When asked why ICICI offers lower rates to new customers at the detriment of the existing ones, Kamath said: &quot;Whatever is our contract with the customers, we will abide by that. If you want to grow as a bank, we need to have rates which are affordable to a customer, whether it is an existing customer or an intending</p>
        <p>customer.&quot; Trying to dispel the impression that ICICI Bank remains reluctant in reducing rates, Kamath said during 2000-05, it reduced floating rates four times &ndash; three times by 50 basis points and once by 25 basis points. </p>
        <p>Pointing out that it was in the interest of banks to have a fair relationship with customers, he said, &quot;Now, if interest rates come down and consistently show behaviour of staying that way, then banks would definitely pass it on to customers.&quot; </p>
        <p>Asked when the bank would start credit-based pricing of <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/">loans</a>, Kamath said it has already been started in corporate lending and for retail customers it would start soon after credit bureaus become fully functional. </p>
        <p>&quot;The next fiscal is too early as (credit bureau) database is not large enough. I think, in the next two years, risk-based pricing would percolate down to the retail sector. We would try to get there quick,&quot; Kamath added. </p>
        <p>ICICI Bank's Executive Director V Vaidyanathan, who heads the bank's retail banking business, said the institution has already started risk-based lending on a pilot basis for its own customers and as the credit bureau database gets bigger, the facility would expand to other banks' customers as well. <br />
          <br />
          &quot;We have started in <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/personal-loans.php">personal loans</a>, but in other products, we need to have the database,&quot; he said. </p>
        When asked whether the mutual-sharing of customer information among banks would hamper the interests of a bank in this cut-throat competition, Kamath said: &quot;No, it is mandatory. And eventually, what is good for the system. It's good for all the banks.&quot; <br />
