        <p>Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday said he does not expect interest rates to go up in reasonable future following the RBI's move to hike mandatory deposits of banks by 0.25 per cent. </p>
        <p>He also expected loans to housing sector to increase without impacting interest rates as the Reserve Bank made changes in the housing loan portfolio norms. </p>
        <p>Chidambaram said he has asked banks to review their derivative portfolio and ensure that customers understand the products. 
          Briefing reporters after a meeting with heads of PSU banks Chidambaram said, "They (banks) are quite happy that only CRR has been hiked and policy rates have been untouched. </p>
        <p>They don't expect the CRR hike to impact interest rates. So going forward, in the reasonable future I do not expect an increase in nterest rates by PSU banks." </p>
        <p>He said banks were particularly happy that there has been some changes in policy regarding housing loans. Now banks have greater freedom to lend up to Rs 50 lakh, he added. </p>
        <p>"So housing sector can expect higher credit flow without impacting interest rates," the Finance Minister said. </p>
        <p>Loans to individual housing sectors grew by 16.44 per cent to touch Rs 1,48,489 crore as on March, against Rs 1,27,522 crore a year-ago. <br>
