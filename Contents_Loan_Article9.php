  <p>
In our day-to-day lives we don't really pay much attention to our short-term financial needs, this is because we don't evaluate our requirement in terms of available products, the costs and benefit attached in the same. Try and answer the below given questions:<br>
<br>
&bull; Why do I need the credit?<br>
&bull; How long I need the credit for?<br>
&bull; Which product is apt for my financial need?<br>
&bull; When will I be able to payback the credit?<br>
&bull; What are the costs involved in various credit options?<br>
&bull; What is the application process?<br>
<br>


There are two financial products, which can meet short-term financial requirement:<br>
<font face="Verdana" color="0F74D4" size="1"></font>Credit card<br>
<font face="Verdana" color="0F74D4" size="1"></font>Personal Loan.<bR><br>

But how do you decide what is your real requirement? Let's analyze different scenarios and then find out which one to choose!<br>
<br>
Credit card is the most flexible form of short-term borrowings with easy repayment options. Credit Card is needed mainly used under following scenarios:<br><br>

<font face="Verdana" color="0F74D4" size="1"></font>When you want to avail interest free credit period for your purchases.<br>
<font face="Verdana" color="0F74D4" size="1"></font>When you want to shop and do not want to carry cash.<br>
<font face="Verdana" color="0F74D4" size="1"></font>To avail reward points / other discount offers.<br>
<font face="Verdana" color="0F74D4" size="1"></font>There may be case that you have a recurring short-term financial requirement.<br>
<br>

Your credit card can really extend your spending power, when used smartly and wisely. Holding a credit card is really beneficial and moreover it has become a requirement in this modern era. Credit Card is a necessity; if you don't have one, <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/applyhere_cc.php" target="_blank">apply now!</a><br>
<br>

Here are some <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/Contents_Credit_Card.php" target="_blank">helpful tips</a> that will help you take the best advantage of your card.
But if you are unable to take the best out of your card, then this is the time to rethink about the idea of taking another credit card? <br>
<br>
Let's answer the following questions and know what your real requirement is:
<br>

a.	 Is this your second / third / fourth / fifth credit card?
b.	 Are you regularly paying only the minimum amount due on your current credit card?
c.	Do you feel the need for an increase in your credit limit on your current credit card?
d.	Do you already have a loan or an emi repayment plan running on your current credit card?
<br>
<br>
For all those who say YES to above given questions, their actual need is of a personal loan NOT a credit card because usage of credit card in this manner has certain constraints attached to it.<br><br>

So now lets find out what are the circumstances under which we should go for a personal loan.<br>
1)You are going through a cash crunch.<br>
2) Need more cash for your day-to-day activities.<br>
3) Need Cash to pay your credit card dues.<br>
4) Require ready cash at lower Rate of interest.<br>
5) You want to distribute your one time heavy expenditure into easy EMIs.<br>

If your requirements match as stated, then <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/applyhere_cc.php">apply</a> for personal loan now!! <br>
<br>

<b>Personal Loan</b> (a need based loan) is a simple answer, which will helps you in availing quick cash and that too on easy terms. It is an unsecured loan not backed by collateral, often used over a short-term basis to cover unexpected expenses like emergency medical expenses, travel expenses or to pay bills on time, to pay your credit dues as well. <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/Contents_Personal_Loan_Mustread.php">Read more</a> about personal loan, and understand the product more.

So the <b>ottom line</b> is to analyze what your actual need is! And according to that decide between a credit card and a personal loan because they are <b>not interchangeable products</b>. The features of both of them have a sea difference, like interest rate charged on credit card (36-40%) is far more than what is charged on personal loan (14-30%), because the two debts have different purposes, perhaps security and risks to the lender.<br>
<br>

Like this analyze your every financial need and then reach to a conclusion keeping in  mind the cost involved for both the options.
