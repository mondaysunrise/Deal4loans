<p>A sweet home dream  turned sour. With the inflationary trend  in the economy persisting, more and more lenders are raising interest rates and  putting that dream home out of reach for the common man. <br />
      This article outlines the  precautions homebuyers should take. It also tries to answer the queries, which  appear on the mind of every individual who wishes to buy a home using a home  loan.<br />
      It analyses what  options are left before the consumers in the current scenario? For instance,  should they simply walk away from property mortgages or hold on for some more  time to avail of the tax benefit? Or would part-prepaying the loan be a better  option? <br />
      <br />
  <strong>Should  I go for Floating or fixed interest rate?</strong><br />
      Increased interest rates  have largely affected the floating rate borrowers. However, fixed rates haven&rsquo;t  been stable either. Fixed home loan rate was viable when interest rates  were 7-8% in 2003 but now it has doubled to 13-14%, thanks to the fluctuating  economic conditions that have resulted into further monetary tightening. This  has inclined people towards floating rate wherein they see both highs and lows  during the long tenure of the loan and do not end up paying higher amounts of  EMI throughout the entire tenure. <br />
      Where as for a fixed interest rate borrower, the picture might not be as  rosy as it seems. Since the borrower must have seen an increase in their EMI,  as the rate is not a pure nor a real fixed rate. While the benefit of floating  rate is that even if the floating rate goes over the fixed rate, it will be for  some period of the loan and not for the entire tenure. <br />
      The decision of  taking a fixed or floating rate loan, however, also depends on what kind of  risk/ reward equation one wants to take. &ldquo;The mortgage loan is normally for  tenure of 15 to 20 years, and the broad analysis by industry standards shows  that the loan typically runs for an average of about 8 years in India. <br />
      <br />
  <strong>Take  note of any fall in the interest rates</strong> <br />
      There are many home loan  plans available in the market. So various banks offer different kinds of home  loan proposals Hence, one must do their homework before deciding what home loan  to avail of..<br />
      However, the homework  doesn&rsquo;t end here. A home loan is one of the most important investments one  makes in their life. Hence, it&rsquo;s important to note any change related to any of  its characteristics. Of the characteristics, the most important tool is the  interest rate.<br />
      Often, banks tend to  increase the interest rates when the benchmark interest rate increases. But,  whenever the benchmark comes down, they go slow in their promptness to inform  the borrowers. There is no point in pondering upon such a behavior of banks as  they have their own clauses in a home loan agreement to support their point.  Benchmark Interest Rate is the minimum interest rate investors will accept for  investing in a non-Treasury security.<br />
      Hence this brings us to the  most important point: you must be careful for the downward revision of interest  rate on your home loan even if there is no change in your EMI. It is yours, not  your bank&rsquo;s responsibility to take notice of a reduced interest rate.<br />
      Therefore, if the interest  rates show a downward trend in near future, ensure to discuss this with your  relationship manager from the lending bank and verify that the downward  revision has been replicated in your interest cost.</p>
      <br />

      <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>A dilemma: A shorter tenure or a lower EMI?</strong> <br />
      As the interest rates of the  home loans increased, borrowers were faced with a dilemma. They had to choose  between the options of either increasing the tenure of the loan or meet up with  a higher EMI. Similarly, the lowered interest rates would mean that borrowers  can either shorten the term or bring down the EMI.<br />
      Experts advice to choose in  favor of short term loans as against lower EMI&rsquo;s to ensure a lower interest  payout. This way even if the rates do increase further at a later date, the  borrowers would have paid up a larger fraction of the borrowed sum. Also in the  case of an increase in the interest rate, the borrowers always have a chance of  increasing the tenure.<br />
      Thus, if the  borrower is young, he can get an extension in his loan tenure. The maximum loan  tenure is 30 years on papers, but going by the current norm and having your age  on your side, some banks won&rsquo;t have any problem in extending it even to 50-60  years! But if the borrower is in his late 40s or 50s, the only option available  in such cases would be to increase the EMI.
<p>However, there are several loopholes in the loan system. The banks need to  be more transparent as far as floating rates are concerned. Decline in the  interest rates are not seen even after an overall fall in interest rates. And  the customers may end up paying more.... <br />
    True,  life is not going to be the same again for a majority of home loan borrowers.  But with a little extra effort, patience and caution, you can still make that  dream come true!! <br><br>
