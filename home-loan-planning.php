        <p>Planning to buy your dream home? It is not  always possible to have so much savings or ready cash for purchasing a home.  Thanks to the facility of home loans that give us the opportunity to own our  dream home. Many banks and financial institutions give us tempting offers to  avail loans in the real estate market. However, one must be careful to collect  all the related information before opting for any offer for loans. It is  crucial to understand all the factors, terms and conditions of repayment. Once  you make up your mind, the next step is getting the money. Getting a home loan  may appear a challenging task, but it can be made simple by keeping a few  points clear in our mind. </p>
        <p><strong>Affordability</strong><br />
          People usually get emotional when it comes to  their homes. However, the decision of buying one should be out and out practical.  The purchase of your dream home should not make a hole in your wallet. Thus,  you must check beforehand whether the down payment and the EMIs are within your  range or not. The down payment you decide to shell out should be planned in a  way that you still have the money to meet any emergency, while the EMIs should  be planned as per the basic rule of not exceeding 45% of your total income.</p>
        <p><strong>Deciding  on the Lender</strong><br />
          Since the loan taker is the customer, the  option of choosing from the lenders is in his court. So, one should do enough  research to decide on the bank or the financial institution. Keep in mind that  don’t go by the offers of just one, but consider at least 5-6 companies before  making your decision. Do check the terms and conditions they are offering and  what exactly suits your requirements. While evaluating the lenders, consider  both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the loan. For instance, the  interest rate is important and may not vary much between the banks but the  customer service, internet banking facilities and other such features may differ  extensively. You must consider these things as you have to manage with them for  the rest of the loan tenure.</p>
        <p><strong>Interest  Rates</strong><br />
          First of all, people obviously look for loans  that come with lower interest rates. During festival season, many banks and  institutions offer home loans at discounted interest rates. Before making any  decision, you must cautiously check as well as have the clear understanding on  the calculation of interest rates. Now the question is whether you’ll go for  fixed or variable interest rates. As we know fixed rate of interest is  generally higher, the monthly EMIs would obviously be higher. So, it is always  better to go for variable or floating rate of interest on your loan. Keep a  check of the interest rate trend. If the interest rates have drastically  increased in a short span of time, you need to reconsider your decision as it  may increase your future EMIs considerably. For this, it would be better to  have a timely follow up with the bank so that you can save on interest, when  the rate changes in your favour.</p>
        <p><strong>Loan  Tenure</strong><br />
          Usually people tend to go for the longer  tenure seeing that the EMIs are more affordable. However, it also means that  you finish off paying more interest. Consequently, your dream home becomes more  expensive. For people who have started working, it is apt to choose long tenure  as affordability would be a major concern. There are chances that you pay EMIs  before the time. In later years of working life, it gets difficult to manage  long tenure loans. </p>
        <p><strong>Credit  Score</strong><br />
          Before approving the loan, every bank or financial  institution checks for your credit score. Credit score is the score card of  your financial life until now. With this, the bank reviews your financial  credibility and the risk associated with their loan payment. A bad credit score  will get you nothing, thus letting your dreams crashed. That's why it is  important to know your credit score from the CIBIL website. It will help you to  fix any mistakes in the score. </p>
        <p>Though home loans offer a nice opportunity to  buy homes without ready cash, it is up to you to understand the terms and  conditions associated with it to enjoy the advantage and save money. As you  take a home loan, you are entering in a long term relationship with your  lender.  <br />
          Taking a home loan entails a long term  relationship with your lender. Hence, keep these pointers in mind while you  hunt for the right home loan for your dream home.</p>
