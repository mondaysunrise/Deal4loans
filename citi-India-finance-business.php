      <div> Citigroup has no plans to exit its consumer finance business in India, where defaults have risen, the head of its Indian unit said on Thursday. <br />
        <br />
        "We are only repositioning and resegmenting the products. Consumer finance is important for India," Sanjay Nayar, chief executive at Citi India, said on the sidelines of a news conference. <br />
        <br />
        Earlier this month, a leading newspaper reported Citigroup had approached several banks to sell its vehicle and construction equipment loans in India because of a drop in margins and a sharp rise in <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/">loan</a> defaults.<br />
        <br />
        Nayar said non-performing assets in the consumer finance segment were much larger than expected, but declined to give details. <br />
        <br />
        "It is classic over indebtedness, consumers were overleveraged, while the underlying capacity remained unchanged," he said. <br>
        <br>
        However, the returns from Citi's Indian business were "satisfactory", he said, without elaborating.<br />
        <br />
        Nayar also said <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/loans/banks/citibank-india/">Citibank India</a> had raised about $500 million in an infrastructure fund with Infrastructure Development Finance Co Ltd. <br>
