            We at Deal4loans try to understand both the  emotional and the financial aspect of taking a home loan. <b>Home loan is a relationship  between the Bank and the customer for an average of 15 years</b>.

<br />
When a contract starts with such faith, the  relationship is cemented for years. We realized at Deal4loans that the <b>customers expect good  rates, trust and an expertise before taking his most important financial  decision of his Life</b>. ICICIHFC with its years of operations has started giving the most of  things what the customer require. There rates may not be cheapest but uniform  for all.<br />
<br />
<b>Few of the customers came and shared there  experiences with us and we could understand how happy and emotional they are in  choosing the ICICIHFC as there preferred Home loan company</b>. For few it was the first  home, for few it was the second or for few who just realized to change there  relationships from others and picked ICICIHFC. <b>The stories are different  but emotions are same. The voices are different but results are same</b>.<br />
<br />
The purpose of doing such an activity at <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com" target="_blank">deal4loans.com</a> is to make the customer understand, that <b>Home  loan is a long term relationship and before you dive into deep sea you should  know what you want when you reach at the shore</b>.<br />

I got calls from three banks and they explained  Rate, amount etc and documentation. I realized rates are same for almost all  banks; it&rsquo;s more to do with process. From the communication I realized ICICI is  offering me rate, better loan amount and convenience and I decided to ask them  to collect documents etc.<b></b><br />  <b>How many days it took  you to complete the entire process?</b><br />
<b style="color:#AC640A;">Customer:</b> The day I had applied at Deal4loans, after  10 days I had received my sanction letter and on 23 rd day I finally moved to  my home. The satisfaction of owning a house is like winning a race. ICICI HFC team was professional  and to the point. So I am happy I choose them and as I have heard people going  crazy when they take home loans.<br />
