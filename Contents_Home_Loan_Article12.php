        <p> Everyone likes hearing people say &quot;Wow, what a beautiful house you have!&quot; From cave dwelling, we have evolved and now a house provides far more than just shelter...it has also become a source of pride. Buying a home requires large capital and good planning as when you decide to purchase a house you do not feel like compromising on anything but your resources are limited. Now with the various <a href="home-loans.php" title="Home Loan">home loan</a> schemes available in the market, you need not get disheartened as home loans can make the dream of an own house turn into reality. </p>
        <p><b>Following are some of the factors used in evaluation of home loan eligibility:</b><br/>
          • 	Nature of Job of Individual: Most <a href="home-loan-banks.php" title="Housing Finance Companies">housing finance companies</a> have a list of 'negative' professions. This can cause a lot of hassles for the individual coming from such professions before being able to get the loan amount.<br/>
          • 	Location of the Property: Likewise, they may consult another list known as 'negative area list'. Any individual applying for the loan to get a home in such areas may not be granted the <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/" title="Loan">loan</a> by housing finance companies. The same is the case with properties falling outside the geographical limits of the city, as defined by the housing finance institutions. <br/>
          • 	Personal Details of individual: Housing finance companies also consider details like the number of people financially dependent on the individual, the individual’s credit repayment history if any and his savings habits.</p>
        <p><b>Tips to finance your home loan</b><br/>
          • 	Club your all incomes to get the best deal
          You can club your spouse’s income, additional incomes like perks, rent and any other income that you immediate family earns. This may help you move to a higher eligibility bracket<br/>
          •  Have a good credit rating
          Lenders will be happier if you can show them a good credit history. Show them that you are not overburdened by <a href="credit-cards.php" title="Credit Card">credit card</a> bills, mortgages and other loans. </p>
        <p><b>Documents Required</b><br/>
          Documents are required by all HFIs but vary based on your occupation, employer, qualifications, experience, etc.</p>
        <p> <b>Income documents:</b> Proof of income, salary certificate, Income tax returns, bank statement etc.<br/>
          <b>Personal documents:</b> Proof of identity like PAN Card/ Voters ID/ Passport/ Driving License.<br/>
          <b>Residence Proof:</b> Proof of residence like recent Telephone Bill/ Electricity Bill/ Property tax receipt/ Passport/ Voters ID /Bank Account statement/passbook for the previous six months.<br/>
          <b>Business Proof:</b> Proof of business address in respect of businessmen/ industrialists<br/>
          <b>Age proof:</b>This is required because all banks have different eligibility criterion as per age.<br/>
          <b>Experience proof:</b> this is another <a href="contents-home-loan-eligibility.php" title="Eligibility">eligibility</a> criterion of banks, according to which the person should have a given amount of experience in the current company.<br/>
          <b>Legal Documents:</b> there are legal documents that need to be submitted by you to the HFC for mortgaging and these differ from state to state and also depend on your property type. The following form a broad outline of the documents required and a detailed list can be found here.
