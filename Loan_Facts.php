   You want  to purchase electronic gadget right from refrigerator to washing machine to  music system you can buy anything but running short of money. All you have to  do is choose from the wide range of financiers but let me clear you about a  fact that people who are offering loan at 0% interest are actually taking your  discount and charging you as interest For ex- Refrigerator sold to you at  Rs.20000/- out of which company offered a discount of Rs.3000/- on it which is  taken by the bank and they charge extra 1-2% as processing fee from you so, if  you had bought it for cash you would have saved Rs.3000 as discount plus Rs.500  as file charges summing up to rs.3500/- so in all you paid interest of 17.5%  flat this is an illustration so, its better to take <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/personal-loans.php" title="Personal Loan">personal loan</a> or credit  card at lower rate of interest. </p></td></tr>
