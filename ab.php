    This is the ideal servcie for any business owner who may not want their
    system to automatically and blindly accept online orders from anonymous
    individuals and charge credit cards 'live' on the open internet without
    them knowing about it - like what happens with typical 'real time'
    payment gateways.<br>
    <br>
    With e-Path the online business owner finally is in control over what
    orders are accepted and what credit cards are charged into their own
    private merchant account.<br>
    <br>
    <div class="inleft">
    <img src="tab/tick.gif" alt="" align="absmiddle" border="0"> A much less expensive system to begin with. <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/e-path_price.html">No gateway transaction fees</a> and e-Path is one of the all time most affordable credit card payment gateways.<br>
    <img src="tab/tick.gif" alt="" align="absmiddle" border="0"> Easy to connect to. No special programs or server side configurations needed.<br>
    <img src="tab/tick.gif" alt="" align="absmiddle" border="0">
    No costly SSL or dedicated IP address needed for your website. Your
    gateway will be fully protected by THAWTE SSL provided by e-Path.<br>
    <img src="tab/tick.gif" alt="" align="absmiddle" border="0"> No <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/pcidss.html">PCI DSS compliance certification</a>
    needed for your website because your website doesn't touch credit card
    data. Your secure e-Path gateway is PCI DSS compliant which means you
    will be <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/payment_gateway_how_it_works.html">accepting credit cards online</a> in accordance with PCI requirements.<br>
    <img src="tab/tick.gif" alt="" align="absmiddle" border="0"> Your <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/payment_gateway_merchant_requirements.html">merchant account</a>
    is completely removed from the vulnerabilities of the open internet.
    Gone are the days when anyone anywhere can transact a stolen credit
    card 'live' into your merchant account without you knowing then you
    have to wear the cost of the loss down the track. That insane risk ends
    with e-Path.<br>
    <img src="tab/tick.gif" alt="" align="absmiddle" border="0">
    If you have an existing EFTPOS terminal approved to allow card not
    present transactions to be entered (MOTO enabled), then you may not
    need another merchant account at all.</div>
    <br>
    e-Path delivers the critical control that is completely missing from
    when you have a credit card payment processing gateway performing
    'live' transactions in real time on the open internet - which is the
    number 1 way online credit card fraud is perpetrated in the world today.</div>

    <img src="tab/hacked.gif" alt="" align="left" border="0">Despite
    the best efforts from within the industry the actual root cause of
    roughly between 85% to 90% (quite possible more) of all credit card
    theft can be traced back to credit card details being compromised
    (hacked into, copied, stolen, etc.) when stored within internet
    accessible storage devices, databases, systems and networks.<br>
    <br>
    Even with this undeniable risk the practice of <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/unplug_critical_data.html">storing critically sensitive credit card and identity data</a> has become common place today, real time payment processing gateways and online shopping carts are examples.<br>
    <br>
    So serious is this risk to the <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/e-path_security.html">security of sensitive credit card and personal identity information </a>that
    many hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each and every year in
    the relentless pursuit to protect this highly confidential data from
    hackers, cyber criminals and internet crooks. The <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/pcidss.html">PCI DSS</a> itself was born from a critical need to help counter this very vulnerability (amongst others).<br>
    <br>Ever evolving techniques and methods invented by unscrupulously
    individuals and criminal syndicates means the battle to defend against
    these threats is an ongoing one, hour after hour, day after day. It is
    a worrying fact that current defences are not always capable of
    protecting your credit card details ....<br>

    However, with e-Path this utmost serious vulnerability, which is the
    core root cause of the majority of credit card and identity theft in
    the world today, has been terminated. It no longer exists.<br>
    <br>
    e-Path has been engineered to eliminate the need for credit card
    details, transaction information and highly sensitive identity details
    to be permanently stored by the payment gateway once and for all.<br>
    <br>
    Once the offical bank approved merchant account owner is in receipt of their customers <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/payment_gateway_how_it_works.html">credit card charge authorisation</a>,
    as far as e-Path and the internet is concerned it is as if that online
    payment never occurred in the first place. Nothing is permanently
    stored by e-Path on the internet. No names, no card numbers, no
    transaction history, no expiry dates. Nothing.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, e-Path terminates the core reason why credit card details
    and other forms of highly sensitive data potentially become available
    to 'hackers', 'fraudsters' and 'cyber criminals' on the internet in the
    very first instance ....<br>

	<b style="font-size:13px; color:#222222; line-height:25px;">American Express Kingfisher Third Credit Card</b><br />

    When a bank provides a business owner with a <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/payment_gateway_merchant_requirements.html">manual merchant account facility</a>
    to enable that business owner to charge credit card payments received
    online through e-Path, the banks exposure to direct risk can be greatly
    reduced than when compared to if it were supplying an internet based
    merchant account facility connected up to a third party 'real time'
    payment processing type gateway.<br>
    <br>
    While card not present transactions remain the highest risk transaction
    type of all, the fact is a manual merchant account will never allow
    anonymous online individuals to directly and automatically transact a
    stolen credit card live into it, the ability of which is the number one
    reason why fraud is so easily perpetrated anonymously online today.<br>
    <br>
    With the current third party 'real time' processing gateway/internet
    based merchant account system anyone anywhere can anonymously enter any
    credit card they like online for it to be communicated live directly
    with the merchant account of a business owner without the business
    owner even knowing.<br>
    <br>
    It can be well argued that the third party 'real time' gateway
    processing system's actual design has inadvertently created the perfect
    made-to-measure tool for 'fraudsters' and 'cyber criminals' to
    facilitate their illegal activities on the internet in the first place.<br>
    <br>
    To counter this, anti-fraud screening services such as 3-D Secure&#8482;,
    Verified By Visa&#8482;, Master Card Secure Code&#8482; etc., can be deployed to
    defend against this open vulnerability. Each are highly potent and
    powerful automated fraud screening systems that are continually being
    improved upon. But circumstances need to be right for them to be
    effective.<br>
    <br>
    There is a crippling multi billion dollar world fraud cost (and
    growing) each year that is hard evidence the automated fraud screening
    systems are not providing unequivocal and guaranteed 100% protection
    for the online business owner against falling victim to fraudsters
    instantly transacting stolen credit cards into a live 'real time'
    gateway and thus directly into the merchant account of the online
    business owner.<br>
    <br>
    However, when e-Path is the gateway, for the first time banks can now
    provide a manual merchant account service to transact credit cards
    received online where <b>only the legitimate bank approved merchant account owner is the only one performing the charge into the merchant account</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="tab/accept_credit_cards_02.jpg" alt="Seeing results from reduced vulnerability" align="left" border="0">The merchant account facility is not being left open and accessible to the entire population on the internet and will <b>not</b>
    allow anonymous individuals to transact any credit card they like into
    it live on the net straight away without you knowing anything about it
    - that appalling vulnerability, which is the actual way near almost all
    online credit card fraud is perpetrated in the world today, is
    completely eliminated when a manual merchant account is used.<br>
    <br>
    Fraudsters and cyber criminals suddenly no longer have the means to
    anonymously transact stolen credit cards 'live' on the net and get the
    live transaction response they look for. This wide open door is shut
    permanently closed when e-Path is the gateway and a manual merchant
    account is the merchant account facility.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, overall exposure to direct risk for both the business owner
    and the merchant account provider (usually a bank) is greatly reduced.<br>
    <br>
    The end result of this is not only substantial potential cost savings
    for both the online business owner and the bank itself but also they
    both have effectively eliminated the very vehicle that enables instant
    online credit card fraud to be perpetrated in the first place.<br>
    <br>
    The bank will also be aware that with a manual merchant account the
    business owner now has the opportunity to check highly pertinent
    details about the buyer and order prior to deciding to charge the card.
    This means the business owner has the chance to identify and terminate
    any fraudulent payment attempts prior to them doing any harm - again,
    something that is not possible when <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/">accepting credit cards online</a>
    'live' on the net via a third party 'real time' processing gateway
    system connected to an internet only based merchant account facility.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that banks can now supply <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/payment_gateway_merchant_requirements.html">merchant account facilities</a>
    that will only allow approved merchant account owner access to charge
    credit cards as opposed to allowing full and open anonymous access from
    anyone anywhere on the entire internet represents a benchmark
    achievement in terminating the number one main method used by
    fraudsters and cyber criminals to actually perpetrate fraud online in
    the fist instance.<br>

    We of course can not speak on behalf of card vendor companies, but the
    fact they can now supply their credit card product to consumers to
    engage in <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/">online e-commerce</a>
    knowing their product will no longer be permanently stored by the
    payment gateway or in internet connected databases, shopping carts,
    storage device or networks, we assume, must be considered as an
    extremely tangible positive.<br>
    <br>Of all the resent security breaches involving credit card payment
    processors, if we take into consideration just the one where 40 million
    credit card were compromised, then the cost to actual card vendors just
    to physically replace those credit cards would be around 400 million
    dollars. It is reported that it costs card vendors roughly around
    $10.00 to physically replace a stolen credit card with a new one.<br>
    <br>Think about that for a moment ... that equates to a 400 million
    dollar cost just only on replacing the stolen credit cards alone, not
    even taking into account the cost of the losses to businesses all over
    the world that only this one breach resulted in.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Yet, had e-Path been the <a class="secure_ecommerce" href="http://e-path.com.au/">credit card payment gateway</a>
    not a single credit card would have been permanently stored anywhere
    online in the first place, therefore, not a single credit card could
    have possibly been stolen. You can't thieve something that doesn't
    exist.</b><br>
    <br>We do not want to infer or imply card vendors have a particular
    attitude or view towards the new e-Path service one way of the other,
    however, we can safely assume there would have been some serious 'back
    patting' going on had they been saved from having to spend 400 million
    dollars, not to mention the incalculable cost that also could have been
    saved that was incurred by every business around the world that
    supplied products or services purchased with those stolen credit cards.</div>
