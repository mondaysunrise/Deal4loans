When the Badge on your page is viewed by someone with a modern web browser, it makes a request to our image servers for the badge and we take note of where this request originated. Then we queue our crawling system to follow up and check the page (where the request originated) and make sure the badge is properly embedded. Then a certificate entry is created.
