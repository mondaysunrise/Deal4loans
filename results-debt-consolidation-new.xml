I have stopped using the credit cards but due to non credibility of paying the dues of credit card on time, its getting higher and higher. So, I am in a terrible condition now. Kindly help me out with some amicable solutions. Eagerly waiting for your reply. Thank you.</description>

&lt;BR&gt;I have a doubt regading the tax to be paid.My friend is into Realestate business.He sells the houses on commission basis.Now the company for which he sells the houses on commission has to pay him above 15 lakhs.It seems the company will deduct some percentage towards tax  from each Lakh and will him the balance.If that is so then he will lose quite an amount.Is there a way for the company to pay without deducting that amount or is there any other way.Pls advise.

&lt;BR&gt;Few years back my grandfather applied for a loan from LIC for construction of his existing property. The papers of existing house were kept as a security. The loan was granted and it is being repaid in form of EMIs. A part of the EMI was adjust for a premium of Insurance policy started at the time of approval of the loan. But it was discontinued due to financial constraints and the policy got lapsed. 
&lt;BR&gt;A month back my grandfather passed away and a major part of the loan is still outstanding. The institution is suggesting us to continue paying the EMIs till the entire loan is repaid. Please suggest some options now so that there are no restrictions/hassles to get the papers of the property back( e.g. intimate about the deceased in writing, transfer the loan in the name of the son of deceased, or continue the loan).
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Thanks. </description>

<pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2008 13:23:55 IST</pubDate>		<description>  Good day...This is chayanath. Iam 26 yrs old.I put farword my case t u.
&lt;BR&gt;we had planned to take a house worth of 28 lakhs.
&lt;BR&gt;The cash in hand is upto 5 lakhs.Since the house is going to be
&lt;BR&gt;completed in another 3 months...i would say the cash can accumulate
&lt;BR&gt;up to 6-7 lakhs.
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;So i jus wanted to know that if i pay the lump-sum amount without seeking the loan
&lt;BR&gt;then can i be able to seek tax exempt???..If so how much???
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;And the other part is iam planning to take 22 lakh loan for the house..so what 
&lt;BR&gt;would be the suitable tenure to repay the loan???
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;ANd can u plz advise on the type of loan i should go for..
&lt;BR&gt;i.e is Fixed loan or Floating type...as my tenure is planned for
&lt;BR&gt;15 yrs minimum.
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;And jus to give a financial state of mine:
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;I work for one of india&amp;#39;s top IT firm.Now i am at Overseas assignment
&lt;BR&gt;been staying for 5 months could extend my stay to another 7-10 months.
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Also to add on I have Salary account with ICICI bank for past
&lt;BR&gt;3 yrs. So will it benefit for me if i approach the ICICI for a home loan.

<pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2008 8:48:55 IST</pubDate>		<description>  In a reducing principal home loan, is it profitable to go for higher interest repayment initially? My bank by default takes out almost twice more in principal repayment than in interest repayment. Does this division come from a calculation? Can I ask my bank to change the amount in the interest and principal components? Does it pay to have a higher interest payment initially in the long run?</description>

<pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2008 11:03:09 IST</pubDate>		<description>  Currently having PL and credit cad loans.
&lt;BR&gt;I have 5 PL&amp;#39;s from 4 different banks:
&lt;BR&gt;Details are as follows:
&lt;BR&gt;Bank    Amt.         Tenure   EMI       EMI paid      
&lt;BR&gt;ICICI    172000       48        4445        25
&lt;BR&gt;ICICI     52000         48        1357        15
&lt;BR&gt;HDFC   175000      48         5420        4
&lt;BR&gt;Axis        149000      48         4240       4
&lt;BR&gt;CitiFin.   75000        48         2500       4
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;None of the above payments have bounced.
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;For credit cards I have following ones:
&lt;BR&gt;Citigold card CL-1,05,000 Credit used-1,02,000 Payment converted to EMI of 3982 for 36 months. Ist payment due on 19th March.
&lt;BR&gt;Have a bobcard CL-40000, Min. due-2000,
&lt;BR&gt;1st min due of 2000 paid , Credit used - 38000.
&lt;BR&gt;Thus if you see my total debt is around 6,00,000. My net take home is Rs.19,250/- + medical + LTA + Bonus will account to Rs.2,500/-. My wife has a household earning of Rs.9,000 p.m  So my total household income is Rs. 30,000 apprx.
&lt;BR&gt;Looking to consolidate the debt with one single bank for a long tenure of 5-7 years.
&lt;BR&gt;My credit history shows no payment with BOB card only once which is way back in 2005. But all dues were paid and the card is fine to use. Secondly, I was cheated by an agent who used photocopies of my documents to get a car loan by making me  guaranter against my consent. The person had forged my initials. Hence, this loan is being shown as a car loan in CIBIL under my portfolio even though I do not own any such loan.
&lt;BR&gt;Plz. guide me as to how should I come of these problems as I am finding it difficult to meet ends.
&lt;BR&gt;Regards,
&lt;BR&gt;Customer.</description>

But I want to know what is the best thing to do?  Is it to increase EMI or to do the Part Payment.  Becasue If I increase the EMi I will lose the Interest paid for 2 years around 1lack. and Now the pricipal Amount is 550000 only.  Plese advice me the best thing to do int his case.</description>

&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;I have taken a loan from ABN Amro and they also provided me a credit card which has a limit of 60,000 but i didn&amp;#39;t use the credit card fully and I pay minimum amount of the card every month but the amount is not reducing at all on the contrary its with HDFC credit card too the principle amount is not getting less I tried applying for loans from the other banks to settle down this issue but every thing goes in vain. I want to get rid of this credit soon is there any other ways where in can get a solution from your side. Please help me out on this.

<pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2008 19:35:29 IST</pubDate>		<description>  Hi Amitoj, 
&lt;BR&gt;I was holding a credit card of HDFC bank and my salary account is also with the same bank. The card limit was 20,000 when it was approved, After some shopping from the card I started paying in installments and the due was getting higher every month. I stopped paying the amount after paying a certain amount and then the bank put me in defaulters list. 
&lt;BR&gt;Is it that I can not apply for a loan or credit card ever in my life? What could be the consequences in terms of my credibility with the bank? Shall I change my bank account? Please help. Thanks.</description>
