      <div> Now, state-run banks will charge 9.25% or <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/home-loans-interest-rates.php">home loan interest rate</a> for the first five years on <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/home-loans.php">home loans</a> up to Rs 30 lakh, in a bid to revive housing demand.<br>
        <br>
        At present, public sector banks offer a special rate of 9.25% for the first five years only on <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com/">loans</a> up to Rs 20 lakh, under a special scheme open till June 30, 2009.<br>
        <br>
        The banks are working to extend the cap for availing of the special offer to Rs 30 lakh by restructuring their loan slabs and keep the offer open for a longer period, executives said. <br>
        <br>
        Corporation Bank, for instance, would do away with two concession slabs of up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5-20 lakh and replace them with a new slab of up to Rs 30 lakh. <br>
        <br>
        “We are working on restructuring of slabs for home loans to bring down the lowest slab to Rs 30 lakh. We find that 75 % of the demand for home loans was in this segment,” the bank’s chairman and managing director JM Garg said. <br>
        <br>
        He said the rate of interest for the first five years will be capped at 9.25% or lower. “There is further room for interest rate cuts and our next asset liability committee is to take a call,” Mr Garg added. <br />
