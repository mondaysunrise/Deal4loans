      <div> Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) which manages funds Worth Rs six lakh crore, will soon launch credit cards and introduce 
        Electronic Data Management System that would enable the Corporation to switch over to paperless policies.
        <p>"LIC, in association with the Corporation Bank is foraying into credit card business by the end of this year we will be launching credit cards," LIC's Managing Director, D K Mehrotra told PTI in an interview. </p>
        <p>"We have a separate company for this purpose which will be wholly owned by the LIC," he said, adding "it will be white-label credit card and will target our existing clientele so that they can use it for payment of premiums." </p>
        <p>LIC also has an ambitious project for Electronic  Data Management System through which all LIC policies would be converted into  digital format, he said.</p>
        <p>Through this system, the entire networking of LIC would be  electronic. This would help customer to make payment of premiums anywhere in  the country and also receive the payment anywhere in the country which was not  the case at present <br/>
