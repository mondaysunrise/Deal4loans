      <div> Card providers have clawed back more than &pound;3 billion worth of credit by cutting their customers' spending limits, research shows. Four per cent of people - around 1.8 million card holders - have had their credit limit cut, to an average &pound;1,600 or a collective &pound;3.1 billion, according to price comparison Web site MoneyExpert.com.
        </p>
        <p>The findings come amid the fall-out from the credit crunch, which has put an end to cheap and easy credit after a period, in which consumers have run up a personal debt mountain of &pound;1.3 trillion. </p>
        <p>Sean Gardner, chief executive of MoneyExpert.com, warned more pain could be on the way. "Overstretched consumers might look to resort to credit in a bid to make ends meet, but they should not rely on it as a way of keeping spending," he said.</p>
        <p>"Credit card companies are becoming stricter in who they lend to and the amount of money their customers can borrow."</p>
        <p>"The warning lights should be shining brightly if you find you're going from card to card without making a dent in the amount you owe." </p>
        <p> There are still some good 0% credit card deals around. HSBC Bank is currently offering an introductory interest-free period of 12 months, Halifax gives nine months, while Lloyds TSB, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland have cards giving six months interest-free. Most borrowers have seen their limits cut by &pound;500 or less and almost half (47%) by less than &pound;1,000.</p>
        <p> But with around 15% witnessing reductions of more than &pound;2,500, the average drop is &pound;1,680. Young borrowers are most at risk of having their limit reduced, with 6% of 25-34 year olds - around 568,600 people - saying their provider has reduced their spending allowance.<br>
