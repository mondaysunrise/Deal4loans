          home is the stamp of his hard work and success. LICHFL with its Home
          loan product attempts people to fulfill that dream.<br />
          <b><br />
          Apko Salam </b>is the Tagline that <b>LICHFL use for all the customers who

            We at Deal4loans try to understand both the emotional and the
financial aspect of taking a home loan. <b>Home loan is a relationship
between the Bank and the customer for an average of &nbsp;15 years</b>. To get
the contract or we may say the relationship between the two, there is
the trust that both have to feel across. So, the relationship starts
at the best points. We at <b>Deal4loans gives choices and the customer
picks up the best, he thinks for himself</b>.<br />
<br />
When a contract starts with such faith, the relationship is cemented
for years. We realized at Deal4loans that the <b>customers expect good
rates, trust and an expertise before taking his most important
financial decision of his Life</b>. LICHFL with its years of operations
has started giving the most of things what the customer require. There
rates may not be cheapest but uniform for all.<br />
<br />
<b>Few of the customers came and shared there experiences with us and we
could understand how happy and emotional they are in choosing the
LICHFL as there preferred Home loan company</b>. For few it was the first
home, for few it was the sixth or for few who just realized to change
there relationships from others and picked LICHFL. <b>The stories are
different but emotions are same. The voices are different but results
are same</b>.<br />
<br />
 The purpose of doing such an activity at <a href="http://www.deal4loans.com" target="_blank">deal4loans.com</a> is to make the
customer understand, that <b>Home loan is a long term relationship and
before you dive into deep sea you should know what you want when you
reach at the shore</b>.<br />
